This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
df <- read.csv('8-2-HOUSE.csv')
```
```{r}
price <- df$saleEstimate_currentPrice
```
```{r}
head(price)
```
```{r}
price_mean <- mean(price)
price_sd <- sd(price)
print(paste("Mean:", price_mean))
```
```{r}
print(paste("Standard Deviation:", price_sd))
```
```{r}
# Plot the PDF of a normal distribution
y <- dnorm(price, mean = price_mean, sd = price_sd)
# Create the plot
plot(price, y, type = "p", main = "Normal Distribution", xlab = "x", ylab = "Density")
```
```{r}
# Calculate the probability density at x = 0 for a normal distribution mean = rating_mean and sd = rating_sd
density_at_0 <- dnorm(0, mean = price_mean, sd = price_sd)
print(density_at_0) 
```
```{r}
# Calculate the cumulative probability for x = 1 for a normal distribution with mean = rating_mean and sd = rating_sd
cumulative_prob <- pnorm(1, mean = price_mean, sd = price_sd)
print(cumulative_prob)

```
```{r}
# Find the x value where the cumulative probability is 0.95
quantile_value <- qnorm(0.95, mean = price_mean, sd = price_sd)
print(quantile_value)
```
```{r}
# Calculate the probability that a value is between -1 and 1
prob_between <- pnorm(1, mean = price_mean, sd = price_sd) - pnorm(-1, mean = price_mean, sd = price_sd)
print(prob_between)
```
```{r}
# Plot the normal distribution with mean = 5 and sd = 2
y <- dnorm(price, mean = 5, sd = 2)

```
```{r}
#install.packages("nortest")

```{r}

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
